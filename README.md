# Unity GPU Accelerated Raytracer

A Ray Tracer built in Unity using compute shaders. It was built as a project for the Graphical Systems curricular unit.

It uses a compute shader to write the ray traced image directly to a RenderTexture. Heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague Ray Tracing in Unity videos.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Unity installed with one of the 2022.3.x LTS versions.
> If you are using Unity 6, I believe the project should run without issues/with minimal fixes.

## Running the application

There are some scene configuration files (in Resources/Config) that are used to build the 3D objects present in the game world. They are also present alongside the executable, so you can modify them to alter the objects in each scene. The configuration files' structure and data as given by the professor, so we could not modify it.

Use the UI buttons to load the scene and modify it in real time!
> Sometimes the application can run slowly, so tweak the settings(image size, lighting settings) if you experience slow downs.

If your changes to the lighting controls are not being displayed, make sure to press the "Local" button and now your changes will affect the scene!
To modify the configuration file used, go to "Assets/Resources/Config" and change the desired filename to "TestScene.txt". The same is applied to the image used for comparision, located in "Assets/SavedImages/3DRenders".
All images are saved to either "Assets/SavedImages/3DRenders" or "Assets/SavedImages/RayTracedImages", depending on how they were generated. They are saved under the following name format: "screenshot_{yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}.png".

## Known Issues
- Eliptical objects are ray traced as spherical objects
